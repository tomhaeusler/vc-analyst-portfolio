# VC Analyst Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of my startup analyses, deal memos, and structured thinking around early-stage venture evaluation.  
It reflects my personal interest in startups, markets, financial logic, and the analytical frameworks used in venture capital.

My goal with this portfolio is simple:  
**to document how I think about companies.**

## 🔍 How to Navigate

- Start with **docs/portfolio-overview.md** to see all startups in one place.  
- Go to **deal-memos/** for full investment-style analyses.  
- Explore **models/** to understand the logic behind financial or ownership structures.  

Actual Excel/Sheets files are not stored here; instead, I document the **reasoning**, **assumptions**, and **structure**, which is often the more meaningful part of early-stage evaluation.
